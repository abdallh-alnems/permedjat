# Same rule as the old backend's deploy.sh, for the same reason: edit code here,
# then run this. A file changed over SSH is invisible to git and gets silently
# reverted by the next deploy, and ad-hoc SQL is how production once had four
# tables local had never heard of.
#
#   ./deploy.sh --dry-run     show what would change, touch nothing
#   ./deploy.sh               push code, install deps, migrate, cache, verify
#   ./deploy.sh --code-only   push code and reload, skip migrations
#
# Requires a `permedjat` host in ~/.ssh/config.
#
# NOT for the cutover itself. The first time this application meets the
# production database, its `migrations` table is empty while the schema is
# already there, and `artisan migrate` would try to CREATE TABLE tenants and
# stop. Run `php artisan permedjat:baseline --pretend` on the server once, read the
# plan, run it for real, and only then use this script. See README, "Cutover".
